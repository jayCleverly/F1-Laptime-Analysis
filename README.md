# F1-Laptime-Analysis

Displays the average lap times for F1 cars and predicts the next 3 years of lap time 

A simple web application, built with streamlit, that analyses the data for average lap times in F1 starting from the introduction of the V6 hybrid era in 2014. All data used in this project has been sourced from https://all-f1-data.com/ords/r/formula1/f1-data/races?tz=0:00. Using the data, a linear regression algorithm is applied to predict the next 3 years of lap times in F1.

Run this project using command "streamlit run main.py".
